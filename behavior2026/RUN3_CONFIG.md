# RUN-3 Config + bring-up (trainer: 1x A100-SXM4-80GB, 300 GB disk, 251 GB cgroup) — 2026-09-06

Scripts: `behavior2026/box_scripts/run3/` (patch_run3_configs, dl_run3, prep_run3_data,
preflight_run3, run3_driver, run3_hf) + top-level `add_sample_weights.py`,
`assemble_run3_mix.py`. Recipe: RUN3_PACKING.md. Bars: RUN3_EVAL_PREREG.md.

## Fork restore (no HF tarball needed)
`openpi_fork/` source tree (base + point-AdaLN, = the HF tarball) → overlay
`fork_snapshot/` 7 files (run-1 layer, rescue branch) → overlay origin/main
`behavior2026/fork_snapshot/data_loader.py` (Run-3 sample_weight layer) → the five Run-2
patches in order (stage_head, map_adaln, depth_aux, modality_dropout, run2_config) →
`patch_run3_configs.py`. `uv sync` (uv 0.12, py3.11); ffmpeg via apt. Verified: jax 0.5.3
sees the GPU; `pi05_radio_run2` and all six `pi05_radio_run3_a*` configs construct.

## Arm configs (`_run3_cfg` in config.py) — what is identical across arms
model = Run-2 flags (pi05, point_conditioning, map_tokens_k=8, modality_dropout 0.2,
map_geo AdaLN, depth_aux, stage_head); warm start `/root/warmstart_run3/params` = Run-2
@49999 with `missing_regex=".*lora.*"` (every module exists → nothing fresh; preflight
check A asserts tree identity); freeze = prefix map-token route (as Run-2); AdamW defaults;
`CosineDecaySchedule(warmup 500, peak 2.5e-5, decay_steps = num_train_steps, floor
2.5e-6)`; batch 32; seed 42; EMA 0.99; save_interval 2,500; keep_period 5,000; norm
stats = Run-2's `assets/b1k_radio/norm_stats.json` copied into every arm's assets dir
(NOT recomputed per mix — identical input normalisation, matches the init checkpoint).
Steps: `_RUN3_STEPS = 15,000` (fixed 2026-09-06 before any launch, identical for all arms):
15k × 32 = 480k samples ≈ 1.0 epoch of the A4 mix; at the measured 3.83 s/step (pure
compute, batch 32, `memprobe_direct.py`) ≈ 16 h per arm, under the one-GPU-day cap.

## Single-GPU memory (measured 2026-09-06)
Batch 32 fits on ONE A100-80GB only under the Run-2 launch flag
`XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.92` (preallocated): JIT 155 s, then 3.83 s/step. With
`XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false` both batch 32 and batch 16 OOM at ~61 GB used + a
17-20 GB allocation (allocator fragmentation, not batch scaling). Fixed state per GPU is
~67 GB (params + grads + Adam μ/ν + EMA at 3.36 B fp32 params). Launch flags are therefore
not optional. `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` is set so the loader's weighting lines reach the log
immediately (the driver's launch gate reads them).

## What differs (the single variable)
`dataset_root` per arm (`prep_run3_data.sh` builds `/root/b1k_radio_mix_a{1..5}` with
`assemble_run3_mix.py`, hardlinked videos) and the launch env: `B1K_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_COL`
unset for A0, `=sample_weight` for A1..A5. `B1K_STAGE_OVERSAMPLE=8` for all.

## Source weights (sample_weight column, decided at launch as RUN3_PACKING.md allows)
map 1.0 with the 10,000 poison-window rows → 0.1; factory 4.78; episodes 2.0; approach
1.0 (the assembler's measured advisory: factory mass ≈ the map's stage-1→2 transition-
neighbourhood mass). The loader multiplies the column into the frame sampler
(WeightedRandomSampler; 464k frames < the 2^24 torch.multinomial cap). The preflight
reads the sampler weights back and records effective mass per source per arm.

## Data gates (prep_run3_data.sh)
restore_map_videos (organizer repo, ~5 GB) → register gt_depth_ds → sample weights (always
`--overwrite-col`, deterministic) → dry-run must print 296 eps / 464,242 frames → per-arm
assembly → deregister depth streams (converter pts jitter; training never decodes depth) →
register sample_weight/gt_depth_ds in each mix → warm start + norm stats. Then
`preflight_run3.py a0 a1 a2 a3 a4` (CPU): tree identity, sampler class + mass, one real
batch per arm. Then a 20-step GPU smoke with a checkpoint write. Then the driver.

## Driver (run3_driver.sh)
Sequential arms A0, A2, A1, A3, A4, (A5 when its mix exists). Per arm: launch via
`scripts/b1k/train_b1k.py` (the only entrypoint that routes `create_b1k_data_loader`),
require the loader's `[stage-oversample]` (+ `[sample-weight]` for A1+) lines within 30 min
or declare a failed launch; every 5 min prune train_state from all but the newest committed
ckpt and push the newest params off-box to `arif101/b26-run3-params/<arm>/ckpt_<step>/`;
≤2 auto-resumes; finalize = upload `<arm>/params`, `<arm>/assets`, `<arm>/provenance/`
(logs, preflight JSON), verify ≥10 GB, slim local to params-only. Any failure stops the
driver (`RUN3_DRIVER_FAILED`).
